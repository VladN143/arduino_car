The project consists in controlling a small car through the wifi signal. This is done through a web page that
behaves like a remote control with 4 buttons that allow movement in 4 different directions. The main objective
of this project was to understand and implement the hardware part but also to connect it with the software part
of the project. In the future I will add more functionalities and different sensors to offer greater practicality to
the project.
